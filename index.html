            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penn's worth.

            <p>
              I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, I1ve successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.

              The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find

              be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
              personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
              and amazing people.

            Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
              needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
              learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
              job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend!
